![Dash Hero](/assets/dash-hero.png)

Welcome to this Flutter Hands-On Project! 
This hands-on experience is designed to help you strengthen your Flutter skills by building a simple yet feature-rich mobile app. 
Throughout this project, you will cover various essential aspects of Flutter development, including theming, widget creation, routing, asset management, model and DTO implementation, and working with HTTP requests using the DIO library with the BLoC pattern.

Getting Started
To get started with this hands-on project, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your development environment. If not, please follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Clone this repository to your local machine to access the project files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on.git
cd flutter-hands-on
```

## Project Structure
The project is organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Flutter development. The primary sections include:

### [Step 1: Theming](https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on/tree/step-1-theming): <- You are here!

- Explore how to set up a theme for your Flutter app.
- Customize colors, fonts, and other visual elements to create a cohesive design.
  
### [Step 2: Widget Creation](https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on/tree/step-2-widget-creation):

- Learn how to create new custom widgets to enhance the modularity and reusability of your code.
- Understand widget composition and inheritance principles.

### [Step 3: Routing](https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on/tree/step-3-routing):

- Implement page navigation using Flutter's routing system.
- Create new pages and manage navigation between them.

###  [Step 4: Assets Management](https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on/tree/step-4-assets-management):

- Import and use libraries and assets such as images and fonts, in your Flutter app.
- Explore best practices for handling assets efficiently.

### [Step 5: HTTP Requests with BLoC](https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on/tree/step-5-http-requests-with-bloc):

- Utilize the Dio library to make HTTP requests in Flutter.
- Implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to manage state and data flow.

### [Step 6: Models and DTO](https://github.com/TheLiux/flutter_hands_on/tree/step-6-models-and-dto):

- Define data models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to structure your app's data.
- Autogenerate code with json_serializable

At the end of this hands-on, you will realize an app that will search and return Movies with all infos available.

## How to Use
Switch to the branch corresponding to the section you want to work on:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

Replace branch-name with the desired branch, such as `step-1-theming`, `step-2-widget-creation`, `step-3-routing`, `step-4-assets-management`, `step-5-http-requests-with-bloc` or `step-6-models-and-dto`.

Follow the instructions provided in each branch's README file to complete the tasks related to that section.

Feel free to experiment, modify, and extend the code to further enhance your understanding of Flutter development.
